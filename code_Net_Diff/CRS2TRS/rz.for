*
*  Rotate an r-matrix about the z-axis.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  vector/matrix support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     PSI      d         angle (radians)
*
*  Given and returned:
*     R        d(3,3)    r-matrix, rotated
*
*  Sign convention:  The matrix can be used to rotate the
*  reference frame of a vector.  Calling this routine with
*  positive PSI incorporates in the matrix an additional
*  rotation, about the z-axis, anticlockwise as seen looking
*  towards the origin from positive z.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_IR       initialize r-matrix to identity
*     iau_RXR      product of two r-matrices
*     iau_CR       copy r-matrix

*
*     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
*        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from

*        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
*        endorsed by SOFA.
*
*     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
*        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
*        from the original SOFA software.
*
*     c) The name(s) of all routine(s) in your derived work shall not
*        include the prefix "iau".
*
*     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
*        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
*        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
*        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
*
*     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
*        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
